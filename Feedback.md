|            Item            | Points Possible | Points Earned|
|----------------------------|:---------------:|:------------:|
| AES Encrypt / Decrypt      |       25        |      25      |
| Blowfish Encrypt / Decrypt |       25        |      21      |
| RSA Encrypt / Decrypt      |       25        |      25      |
| RSA Sign / Verify          |       25        |      25      |

### Feedback(s)
* Your implementation uses Blowfish in ECB mode which is the least secure mode of operation for block ciphers. (-4)
* In extra credit section, you should have printed the proportions as floats instead of integers. "Blowfish is 0 times faster than AES" does not make any sense. (No deduction)
